 * *The main Sipana "competitor"*
 * VQManager is a proprietary system;
 * The current version doesn't have distributed clients/sniffers to capture and send information to a server. Each environment should have its own VQManager installation as described in this [http://forums.adventnet.com/viewtopic.php?t=701791 thread];
